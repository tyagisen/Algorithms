# Brute Force Approach (Time complexity: O(n^2), Space Complexity: O(1))
    All Possible ways or all the possibe solutions to a given problem are enumerated. 
    Many problem solved in day to day life using brute force algorithm, 
    for example exploring all the path to a nearby market to find the minimum shortest path
    -Arrange the books in a rack using all the possibilities to optimize the rack spaces, etc.
    -In fact daily life activities uses a brute force nature even though optimal algorithms are also possible.

## Props 
    -The brute force algorithm is a guaranteed way to find the correct 
    solution by listing all the possible candidate solutions from the problem.
    -It is generic method and not limited to any specific domain of problem.
    -The brute force method is ideal for solving small and similar problem.
    -It is know for its simplicity and can serve as a comparison benchmark.

## Cons
    -The brute force approach is inefficient for real time 
    problems, algorithm analysis ofter goes above (O(n!)) order of growth.
    -The method more relies on compromising power of computer system for solving than on a good algorithm design.
    -The algorithm is not constructive or creative comapred to algorithms that are constructed using somem other design paradigms.

## Conclusion
    Brute force algorithm is a technique that guarantee solutions for problems of 
    any domain helps in solving the simpler problems and also provide a solution 
    that can serve as a benchmarks for evaluating other design techniques, 
    but takes of run time and inefficient.
